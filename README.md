One-point-oh Release Date: Q4 2012 (Exact date will be designated later)

Mission/Purpose
-----------
This project is designed to make a fairly low cost webserver on a Arduino that is able to serve the common home user
who wants to share his/her vacation photos with their friends. Since the Arduino is no monster in processing power, any kind of
dynamic content is out of the question.

Requires
-----------
* Arduino Uno

* Ethernet Shield

* FAT16/32 Formatted MicroSD
